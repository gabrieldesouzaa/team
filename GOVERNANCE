# Onboard AI – Governance Model

## Team Roles & Responsibilities  
- **Project Lead:** Oversees timeline, deliverables, and communication.  
- **Technical Lead:** Builds prototype and manages integrations.  
- **Research Lead:** Ensures regulatory compliance and gathers healthcare requirements.  
- **QA Lead:** Tests AI outputs, ensures usability and compliance with standards.  

*(Roles will rotate in future stages to share responsibility.)*

## Collaboration Protocol  
- **GitHub Usage:**  
  - Issues: Track tasks and assign owners.  
  - Projects: Kanban board for sprint planning.  
  - Pull Requests: Required for merging code, reviewed by at least one team member.  

- **Meetings:** Twice weekly check-ins (Mon/Thu) + async updates in GitHub Discussions.  
- **Visibility:** All work must be committed, reviewed, and linked to Issues.

## AI Usage Strategy  

### Task Delegation  
- **Ad-hoc AI use:** brainstorming features, generating boilerplate code, drafting docs.  
- **Systematic automation:** generating unit tests, summarizing meeting notes, validating data entry.  

### Collaboration with AI  
- AI will be treated as a **junior collaborator** — useful for drafts, but all outputs must be reviewed by a human.  
- AI contributions will be noted in commit messages or comments for transparency.  

### Verification & Citations  
- Critical outputs (e.g., compliance steps, calculations) must be manually validated.  
- External sources suggested by AI must be cited properly in documentation.

## Decision-Making Framework  
- Decisions made by **majority vote** within the team, with the Project Lead breaking ties.  
- Disagreements resolved through:  
  1. Clarifying user/business value.  
  2. Testing a small prototype or experiment.  
  3. Escalating only if unresolved.  

**Guiding principle:** *progress over perfection* — keep moving forward.
